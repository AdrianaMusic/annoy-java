DESCRIPTION
------------

Java library for annoy, the C++/Python approximate nearest neighbor library.

This library only reads (does not create) and only handles float angular
indices (not Euclidean ones).  This covers 99% of the functionality we need.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Documentation for this project should be found in the doc directory.
